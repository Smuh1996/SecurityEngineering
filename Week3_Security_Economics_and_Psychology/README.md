### Task 1: Lock-ins


Technological lock-in can be defined as when a society or market is dependent on a specific technology and it is difficult to switch on other technologies due to high switching cost. A good example is the QWERTY keyboard option which has remained the same in computer keyboards even though there are a lot better options came. This lock-in can be good but it limits innovation and prevents the adoption of new technologies.
Vendor lock-in occurs when a customer depends on a particular vendor for some specific products or services. It can be costly and not easy to switch. This is very common in cloud computing, where the process of moving data and applications to another provider is time taking and can be costly.
This means that switching from these lock ins cannot be an easy process, it could be very costly and time-consuming and there can be some things included in it like staff training, hardware and software data transfer. Sometimes staying within a lock-in can be safer and more convenient in terms of cost and/or schedule. But the main drawbacks can be included higher cost, reduced innovation and reliance on a single vendor for a too long time.

### Task2: Security Psychology



Why Are Phishing Attacks Effective Enough to Be Widespread Practice?

Phishing attacks are effective because they directly attack human psychology. Attackers create messages that look like the real and people can be easily manipulated to provide their sensitive information like, passwords or credit card number. These kinds of messages create an urgency, so the people provide anything without thinking. The excessive use of email and social media can make it very easy for attackers to get the sensitive information. With the evolution of technologies the attackers also upgrade their tactics so it can be very difficult for user to identify the real or fake messages .So this combination of social media and the technology is making the phishing a very common and effective practice.

Why Does Social Engineering Work on People?

Social engineering works because it takes advantage of emotions and behavior .Mostly people trust on authorities and urgency and they answer them .Attackers mostly act like authority or create and urgency case so people get panic and it  forces people to respond and provide them sensitive information. Social engineers mostly work on all those the information that they get from social media. As the information they get is legitimate and it looks credible. And the users can easily be manipulated, and they provide attackers the sensitive information.


Why Do Many People Have a Hard Time Using Passwords in a Secure Way?

Many people struggle with a secure password, and they prefer to use the simple and easily guessable password. As in most cases they don’t want to get confused with a lot of characters and symbols, so they prefer simple passwords. Additionally, people are not aware of password protection and the two factors authentication. Now a days people have more than one account, so they don’t want to get confused between so many passwords and they prefer simplicity. As a result, it easier for attackers to crack these simple passwords.

Why Does PGP Fail to Be an Effective Way to Secure Email?

There are many reasons of the adoption of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy). The first reason is that it might be difficult to understand for an average user because it requires the technical knowledge to use the setup effectively. Mostly users find the key generation, message encryption and key pairing difficult depends on a web of trust model that can be confusing and also can be difficult to verify the authenticity of the key. A lot of email providers don’t integrate PGP as the native and because of this the accessibility can be limited. And these things can be a big hurdle for email security solutions.

Why Is It So Easy to Spread Malware?

Because of interlinked nature of internet and the excessive usage of digital devices it is easier to spread malware. The attackers can use different ways like email attachments, different websites and infected software download so the malware can be distributed easily. Mostly social engineering techniques also can be done this way that pushes user to open a link download something from a website. Besides this, there are a lot of devices that lack updated security software and user awareness. Online information sharing can also be a part of spreading malware quickly.



## Task 3:

### Task3A: Intellectual Rights


Task3A:
 Intellectual Rights Companies prioritize safeguarding their assets, encompassing both tangible and intangible aspects. This protection involves utilizing legal mechanisms like: 

intellectual property (IP) : 

Intellectual property means the creations of human mind including so many things like inventions and artistic work. It allows the creator to use it ability and take advantage of it

Copyrights: 

Copyrights basically provide the protection to original work It gives the creator rights of reproduce, distribute, and display their own work.

Patent: 

A patent gives inventor the exclusive rights for the inventions for a certain time period. It means that the inventor has right to stop others for making, using and selling the inventions.

Trademark: 

A trademark is used to protect symbols, names, and slogans to identify goods or services. It differentiates two products from different companies to prevent any confusion in market.

 Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) along with employing technologies such as:
Watermarks:

 Watermarks can be added to the pictures or documents.It shows the ownership and also can be helpful to stop the use of unauthorized and reproduction .

Software licenses : 

Software licenses are agreements that decide that how the software can be used and distributed.

Digital rights management (DRM):

 It controls the use and distribution of digital content. It also stops sharing and unauthorized copying. It asks the creators to implement the restriction their content .

Software protection dongles:

Dongles are the devices that are attached to the computers and work as a key to run a software. They also help to prevent the unauthorized use of the software.
